467,"Instead , Sununu sought to prove to the president that his supporters outnumber his critics and that he should remain in his post .",0
468,"One senior official Monday described the White House as "" a collection of small groups of aides holding their breaths , "" waiting to see whether Sununu survives .",0
469,"One GOP source , reporting on a call from the chief of staff to a Republican leader , said Sununu lamented that "" the noose is tightening around my neck , and I need your help . """,0
470,;,0
471,Another highly placed source said the president 's son met with Sununu last week after holding a series of conversations about the structure of the White House staff and of the campaign with other Bush loyalists and GOP activists .,0
472,"That , the source said , was when Sununu started calling congressional Republicans and asking them to tell Bush that the conservative wing of the party , in particular , would object if he were fired .",0

474,Mr. Potach says the growth is surprising since membership in hate groups usually declines during periods of economic prosperity .,1
475,"Mr. Potach notes older , more traditional groups like the Ku Klux Klan are also opening new chapters , thanks in part to their ability to use new technologies like the Internet .",1
476,Law enforcement authorities say such reports are likely to increase as police departments are now beginning to more accurately report hate crimes than they have in the past .,1
477,"While the expansion of the Internet has been a blessing for researchers , students and the just plain curious , the new opportunities mentioned by Mr. Gates are also being used by some rather unsavory characters .",0
478,A new report says there has been a dramatic rise in the growth of hate groups in the United States over the past year .,0
479,And many of them are using the Internet to spread their messages of racial superiority .,0
480,VOA 's Jim Teple has details from our southeast news bureau .,0
481,"The Southern Poverty Law Center , a civil rights monitoring group based in Montgomery , Alabama , has long monitored such groups as the Ku Klux Klan .",0
482,More recently it has followed the growth of the militia movement and church groups that preach a message of white supremacy and anti-semitism .,0
483,"The new study written by Mark Potach , who edits the Southern Poverty Law Center 's Intelligence Report , warns that such groups grew rapidly last year , mostly by recruiting younger members .",0
484,Mark Potach says over four hundred hate groups have been identified and many are becoming increasingly successful at recruiting younger members through the use of Internet web pages and the promotion of racist rock music .,0
485,"The Internet has certainly helped uh hate mongers to organize and uh to feel that they are part of a larger community , even if uh they are essentially uh , you know , angry people sitting in their bedrooms uh all alone .",0
486,"Uh , in addition , white power racist music has become uh quite popular in certain sectors .",0
487,"Uh , there are over fifty thousand CDs a year sold with uh lyrics that are quite uh unbelievable .",0
488,Many of these new members are joining chapters of the so called Christian Identity Movement which cites Biblical scripture as a foundation for a belief in white supremacy and anti-semitism .,0
489,Mark Potach says such members are also intensely attracted to apocalyptical fantasies .,0
490,The approach of the year two thousand has many of these groups in a kind of millennial frenzy .,0
491,"Uh , uh a - they believe , or at least many of them believe , uh that they are approaching the Battle of Armageddon in which they will be pitted against the uh kind of Satanic forces trying to take over the world .",0
492,UNOS spokeswoman Donna Henry Wright says the new policy would not necessarily be more fair or effective because allowances are already made for the most needy patients .,1
493,UNOS spokeswoman Donna Henry Wright says the new policy would not necessarily be more fair or effective because allowances are already made for the most needy patients .,1
494,um So it 's a - it 's a fallacy that they 're doing this because um the sickest patients are n't being served .,1
495,The US government recently announced new regulations designed to change the way transplant organs are made available to sick patients .,0
496,"Under the new guidelines , donor organs will be made available to the sickest people first , wherever they live in the country .",0
497,"Currently , transplant organs are rationed through a regional system of distribution .",0
498,"The private group that runs the current system , United Network for Organ Sharing , or UNOS , objects to the new regulations .",0
499,UNOS says the regulations put the federal government in charge of deciding who gets transplants and that many hospital transplant centers would be forced to close .,0
500,"Health and Human Services Secretary Do - Donna Shalala says patients who need an organ transplant should not have to take a chance that an organ will become available in their local area , nor should patients have to travel to transplant centers far from their homes to improve their chances of getting an organ .",0
501,There are not huge waiting uh disparit - waiting time disparities amongst the very uh sickest patients .,0
502,It 's between two to six days for every one uh of the sickest patients across the country .,0
503,"You may , in a year or two , save a few more lives if you do sickest first .",0
504,"But the number of patients waiting then begins to increase , um and , in fact , um over the years many more patients who are about to die of liver tra - uh without a liver transplant would accumulate .",0
505,"If you do the uh alternative extreme , you do n't save as many lives in the early years , by a small fraction .",0
506,"Our system is balanced , it 's right in the middle .",0
507,"And , therefore , it works very well .",0
508,"Nationwide , there are about ten thousand patients waiting for liver transplants each year and only four thousand organs become available for transplants .",0
509,"Secretary Shalala says UNOS five months ago , or gave them five months to develop a new plan to distribute livers which are in the shortest supply .",0
510,"Secretary of State James Baker , speaking on ABC News ' "" This Week , "" said the Kuwaiti request gives the U.S. and other countries "" a legal basis for stopping the export of oil and that sort of thing . """,1

513,"In a statement , the White House said it would do "" whatever is necessary "" to ensure compliance with the sanctions .",1
514,"Speaking on the ABC program , Abdul Amir al-Anbari , Iraq 's ambassador to the U.N., asserted that an embargo on Iraq could plunge the U.S. into a "" depression "" and the rest of the world into an economic "" crisis . """,1
515,"Speaking on the ABC program , Abdul Amir al-Anbari , Iraq 's ambassador to the U.N., asserted that an embargo on Iraq could plunge the U.S. into a "" depression "" and the rest of the world into an economic "" crisis . """,1
516,"Iraq clearly is trying to woo back more Arab support in case the conflict drags on , hoping that its neighbors eventually will help it survive a prolonged war of economic attrition with the West . So Saddam Hussein on Friday tried to scare other Arab leaders into supporting him by calling on Arabs to rise up in a holy war against leaders who invited American and other Western soldiers into Saudi Arabia to protect the oil-rich kingdom .",1
517,"Then yesterday , he tried to entice Arab leaders with his proposal for a diplomatic solution linking his occupation of Kuwait with Israel 's occupation of the West Bank .",1
518,"American strategists are calculating , though , that the trade sanctions -- enforced by an effective though perhaps undeclared naval blockade -- will hold tightly enough to convince Iraq that it will lose in the long run by simply standing pat .",1
519,"But that option is growing less and less likely as thousands of American , British , Egyptian , Syrian and Moroccan forces assemble in and around Saudi Arabia to protect the kingdom .",1
520,Israel has publicly declared that it will respond to an Iraqi attack on Jordan because it wo n't allow Iraq 's dangerous army to take control of Jordan 's long border with Israel .,1
521,There are disagreements among experts about how much pressure will be needed to make Saddam Hussein decide he 's up against the wall and whether simple economic pressure will ever be enough .,1
522,""" That shows he 's nervous about pinpointing his location , either because he 's afraid we 'll find him , or that internal enemies will , "" says one U.S. official .",1
523,The unpredictability of Iraq 's leader is a principal reason the U.S. is going to such great lengths to build a mammoth force in and around Saudi Arabia .,1
524,And the U.S. is taking similar steps to ensure that its naval force is adequate to carry out a blockade of Iraq and support a war if necessary .,1
525,"Iraq 's Saddam Hussein , his options for ending the Persian Gulf crisis growing increasingly unpleasant , assumed the role of embattled Arab hero in offering his first rough proposal for a negotiated end to the confrontation .",0
526,"The Iraqi leader , in an "" initiative "" designed as much to rally Arab public opinion as to launch meaningful negotiations , announced yesterday that he will withdraw his troops from Kuwait only if Israel withdraws from the West Bank and Syria from Lebanon .",0
527,"He apparently hopes to lure support from Arabs who have spurned him so far by suggesting that Iraq will use its occupation of Kuwait as a lever to solve the Arab world 's most frustrating problem , the 23-year Israeli occupation of land claimed by Palestinians .",0
528,"Even as Saddam Hussein was searching for a ploy to ease his isolation , though , the international pressure against him clicked up another notch .",0
529,"The White House yesterday disclosed that Kuwait 's ousted government has formally asked the U.S. to enforce the total trade embargo the United Nations has imposed on Iraq , allowing the U.S. and other nations to immediately begin stopping ships carrying Iraqi goods .",0
530,President Bush implied as much yesterday when reporters asked whether the interdiction would apply to food .,0
531,"The president responded , "" Everything , everything . """,0
532,"While shying away from actually using the word "" blockade , "" Mr. Bush acknowledged that the U.S. and others were trying to block shipping to Iraq .",0
533,""" No point getting into all these semantics , "" he said .",0
534,""" The main thing is to stop the oil from coming out of there . """,0
535,The naval interdiction force is part of an overall American strategy that officials say is designed to leave the Iraqi leader with only the stark choice of backing out of Kuwait or launching new attacks to change his situation .,0
536,"Though they insist they are n't trying to lure Saddam Hussein into an attack , officials hope that if he strikes again , the U.S. and its allies will have such an impressive force in place in Saudi Arabia that they will be able to crush him in retaliation .",0
537,"Iraq 's first option , of course , may be simply to sit tight and hope it can endure a trade embargo longer than the West can live without Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil .",0
538,"The Bush administration immediately said it "" categorically "" rejects the proposals .",0
539,"And President Bush yesterday , asked whether he was at least glad Iraq is discussing negotiations , replied : "" I do n't see anything to be pleasing in there at all . """,0
540,"In that event , Saddam Hussein appears to have three choices .",0
541,"The first would be to launch the much-feared direct invasion of Saudi Arabia , hoping to seize some Saudi oil fields and improve his bargaining position .",0
542,"The Saudi "" window of vulnerability ... is closing very fast , "" Prince Bandar bin Sultan , the Saudi ambassador to Washington , said over the weekend .",0
543,"The second possibility would be to start a fight with Israel , in hopes that all Arabs would have to move behind Iraq in a fight against their common Israeli enemy .",0
544,"In such an event , Saddam Hussein also might calculate , the Saudis would be under pressure to kick out U.S. troops because of America 's close ties with Israel .",0
545,Iraq could start hostilities with Israel either through a direct attack or by attacking Jordan .,0
546,"Two Middle East terrorists with records of successful attacks against Western targets , Abu Nidal and Abu Abbas , have ties to Baghdad .",0
547,And even terrorist groups that opposed Iraq in its war with Iran show signs of swinging behind Saddam Hussein now that he is in a confrontation with the U.S. And Iraq still has thousands of Americans and other Westerners under its control in Iraq and Kuwait .,0
548,They are n't being allowed to leave and could become hostages .,0
549,"If Iraq chooses a simple war of nerves and economic attrition , the Bush administration knows a long stalemate could try the patience of the American public and the West in general , and could open the possibility that moderate Arabs -- even including Saudi Arabia -- might drop out of the effort against Iraq and accept some deal from Saddam Hussein .",0
550,"But U.S. officials have sized up Saddam Hussein as a man who , despite some recklessness , will back down if he must .",0
551,""" This is a guy who is impulsive , and therefore capable of big miscalculations , "" says one senior administration official involved in managing the crisis .",0
552,"The official adds , though , that "" at the same time , we think he is someone who is capable of rational judgments when it comes to power .",0
553,"And when he finds something is unprofitable , then one can see certain accommodations . """,0
554,"Thus , administration aides will be trying to calculate whether Saddam Hussein 's proposed diplomatic formula for getting out of Kuwait represents the first sign he is searching for a way out or simply is a public relations stunt .",0
555,U.S. officials claim they already see signs Saddam Hussein is getting nervous .,0
556,"In the first days after President Bush announced the dispatching of U.S. troops , they note , the Iraqi leader made several nationwide addresses indirectly -- having them read by a television announcer .",0
557,"But the administration is n't putting any upper limit on how high the force could go after that , calculating that it would be a mistake to underestimate and an advantage to keep Saddam Hussein guessing .",0
558,"U.S. commanders in charge of planning for Middle East crises have indicated in the past that they were capable of deploying as many as 300,000 troops .",0
559,Three other carriers and their escort vessels already are stationed within striking distance of Iraq or are steaming toward the area .,0
560,"But unless the military situation changes drastically , military officials say , the most likely plan will be for the Kennedy to eventually replace the carrier Dwight D. Eisenhower , which has been on patrol since March and was scheduled to return to port before hostilities erupted in Kuwait .",0
561,But even continued military success carries political and diplomatic risks for President Bush and the U.S.,1
562,The allied rejection of the last-minute Soviet-led diplomatic effort to avoid the ground war enabled Mr. Bush to seize the initiative from an Iraq seemingly bent on dictating peace terms .,1
563,"Nevertheless , American officials over the weekend became more open in declaring that by destroying Saddam Hussein 's military machine they hope to destroy his regime -- a goal likely to be supported by most Americans .",1
564,"Secretary of State James Baker said on ABC - TV 's "" This Week With David Brinkley "" that the series of United Nations resolutions condemning Iraq 's invasion of Kuwait "" imply that the restoration of peace and stability in the Gulf would be a heck of a lot easier if he and that leadership were not in power in Iraq . """,1
565,Iraq still has the potential to cause significant problems by using forces and weapons that do n't yet seem fully engaged .,1
566,"Despite these early successes , the mere fact that a ground campaign has begun almost guarantees that the Bush administration will face fresh problems growing out of the military situation .",1
567,The Bush administration considers the sanctions essential to keeping Saddam Hussein under control should he survive the war .,1
568,"Mr. Bush forestalled further diplomatic maneuvering by issuing an ultimatum on behalf of the allies demanding that Iraq withdraw within a week , starting at noon Saturday .",1
569,"After cabling world leaders about his intention to give Saddam Hussein a final deadline to exit Kuwait , he offered him a week to withdraw fully , instead of the four days he originally considered , because of objections from some European partners that four days seemed punitive and unrealistic .",1
570,"Meanwhile , the U.S. hopes , economic sanctions and an international arms embargo will remain in effect until Iraq pays war reparations to Kuwait to cover war damages . That would undermine any chances of rebuilding either Iraq or its armed forces in short order as long as Saddam Hussein remains in power .",1
571,"If that 's true , the narrowing of his support would make it easier for someone to push him aside from within .",1
572,"Yet , paradoxically , the perception that the U.S. wants to destroy Iraq may increase Saddam Hussein 's support within the Iraqi military .",1
573,""" So far , the offensive is progressing with dramatic success , "" said a buoyant Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf , commander of U.S. forces .",0
574,"Similarly , while cautioning about the uncertainty of early battle reports , White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said late yesterday that "" the operation has been very successful . """,0
575,"Amid reports that thousands of Iraqi soldiers had surrendered , administration aides were also upbeat in private , with one even talking of victory within a week .",0
576,""" Why have a war ? """,0
577,"asked Abdul Latif Shekar , a customs officer in Egypt , a country participating in the attack on Iraqi troops .",0
578,""" I think the Gorbachev plan was a good one .",0
579,"Iraq was ready to withdraw . """,0
580,"Now , he says , "" it looks like the West just wants to destroy Iraq . """,0
581,"Despite the early indications of success , the allied forces could still suffer greater casualties and become bogged down militarily , especially when they encounter the tough Republican Guard , which is entrenched along the Iraq - Kuwait border .",0
582,"If so , and if it appears that the American goal actually is to destroy the Iraqi regime even at the cost of badly hurting Iraqi society , "" the lingering cost of that could be high , "" worries former national security adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski .",0
583,"But , he notes , "" If everything crumbles totally , that wo n't be such a problem . """,0
584,"American officials staunchly disavow any interest in driving through Iraq toward Baghdad , either in pursuit of Saddam Hussein himself or to set up some American-controlled government inside Iraq .",0
585,"The Americans say their battle plans call for operating against forces inside Iraq as far north as the city of Basra , about 30 miles north of Kuwait , but say there is n't any plan to drive beyond that .",0
586,"Indeed , French President Francois Mitterrand said yesterday that some allied forces are crossing Iraqi territory as part of a "" pincer "" movement to trap the soldiers occupying Kuwait , but insisted , "" The purpose is n't to invade Iraqi territory , that 's not the aim , that is n't the mandate . """,0
587,"He went on to add that "" in so doing you not only return a nation to its people , but you will destroy the war machine of a ruthless dictator . """,0
588,"Gen. Schwarzkopf said that some early reports that chemical weapons were used against allied troops turned out to be "" bogus . """,0
589,"Iraq is believed to have the ability to deliver chemical weapons in artillery shells or , perhaps , atop Soviet-made Frog7 missiles .",0
590,"Perhaps more important , it appears that allied troops have n't yet fully engaged Iraq 's vaunted Republican Guard , which has been sitting just north of the Iraq - Kuwait border and is considered the most potent element in the Iraqi defense .",0
591,"It remains to be seen how much damage the allied air campaign was able to inflict on the Guard , and whether President Hussein will commit his most valued troops to a fight-to-the-death finish .",0
592,"Certainly Saddam Hussein continues to implore his country to fight on . """,0
593,"Fight them , "" he urged Iraqis in a radio address .",0
594,""" All Iraqis , fight them with all the power you have , and all struggle for everything . """,0
595,"American war planners have long assumed that the early stage of the ground attack , in which American forces would use their speed to sweep around Iraqi defenses and their strength to punch through the relatively weak Iraqi front line , would be the easiest part .",0
596,"U.S. and Kuwaiti officials say there are reports that large numbers of civilians from Kuwait City are being rounded up and held by Iraqi troops , apparently either for use as human shields or for use later in bargaining once the war is over .",0
597,President Bush 's political argument for going to a ground war has been strengthened by the growing stream of reports of wanton Iraqi destruction inside Kuwait .,0
598,U.S. officials say that hundreds of Kuwaiti oil wells now may have been set afire .,0
599,"And Robert Gates , Mr. Bush 's deputy national security adviser , asserted in an interview on the Cable News Network that Iraqi troops have set fire to "" large sections "" of Kuwait City .",0
600,Mr. Bush and his aides were leaning toward a military conclusion of the crisis even before the latest reports of Iraqi atrocities in Kuwait came to light .,0
601,The president and his top aides tentatively decided on Feb . 11 that a ground war would be necessary .,0
602,"The decision was made after Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and Gen. Colin Powell , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , returned from a visit with military commanders in Saudi Arabia , administration officials say .",0
603,"Then , a week or so ago , Gen. Schwarzkopf secretly picked Saturday night as the optimal time to start the offensive .",0
604,The date was unaffected by the last-ditch Soviet peace initiative .,0
605,"The real problem with the Soviet proposals , U.S. officials now say , was that they all would have required lifting economic sanctions against Iraq .",0
606,"He argued setting an explicit deadline for Saddam Hussein to break would , when it was broken , give the U.S. military a clear green light to proceed .",0
607,"In setting out his final challenge to Saddam Hussein , Mr. Bush continued the intensive personal diplomacy he began after the invasion last August .",0
608,"Finally , when Iraq failed to respond to the U.S. ultimatum , Mr. Bush let the ground offensive begin as previously planned Saturday night .",0
609,"The attack was lightning quick , as allied forces punched through tall sand berms on the border and pushed forward into Iraq and Kuwait .",0
610,U.S. Marines were said to have breached troublesome mine fields along the Iraqi lines but Pentagon officials said no amphibious assault on Kuwait 's beaches had begun .,0
611,Long columns of Iraqi prisoners of war could be seen trudging through the desert toward the allied rear .,0
612,"U.S. commanders said 5,500 Iraqi prisoners were taken in the first hours of the ground war , though some military officials later said the total may have climbed above 8,000 .",0
613,"The U.S. hopes its troops will drive Iraqi forces out of Kuwait quickly , leaving much of Iraq 's offensive military equipment destroyed or abandoned in Kuwait .",0
614,It expects that tens of thousands of Iraqi soldiers will surrender to the U.S. and its allies over the next few days .,0
615,"If the allies succeed , Saddam Hussein will have plunged his country first into a fruitless eight-year war against Iran and then into a humiliating war against the U.S. and the allies to defend his conquest of Kuwait , leaving much of his country 's military establishment and modern infrastructure in ruins .",0
616,Outside analysts think Saddam Hussein 's position is indeed precarious .,0
617,""" I think frankly Saddam is finished , no matter what happens , "" says Christine Helms , a Middle East scholar who has written extensively about Iraq .",0
618,""" These guys simply do n't retire to condos over the Euphrates . """,0
619,"Despite the lack of any obvious successors , the Iraqi leader 's internal power base appeared to be narrowing even before the war began .",0
620,Some analysts say he appeared to be relying on a smaller and smaller circle of close advisers and relatives .,0
621,""" We looked to the United States , we expected you to have the moral edge , "" says Nasser Tahboub , a Jerusalem-born Jordanian who has an American wife and a doctorate in political science from Duke University .",0
622,""" Now we see that edge eroded .",0
623,"For me , it is a great tragedy .",0
624,"For the first time in history , the U.S. has gone to war with an Arab and Muslim nation , and we know a peaceful solution was in reach . """,0
625,The action came in response to a petition filed by Timex Inc. for changes in the U.S. Generalized System of Preferences for imports from developing nations .,1
626,"The White House said Mr. Bush decided to grant duty-free status for 18 categories , but turned down such treatment for other types of watches "" because of the potential for material injury to watch producers located in the U.S. and the Virgin Islands . """,1
627,"The White House said President Bush has approved duty-free treatment for imports of certain types of watches that are n't produced in "" significant quantities "" in the U.S., the Virgin Islands and other U.S. possessions .",0
628,"Timex had requested duty-free treatment for many types of watches , covered by 58 different U.S. tariff classifications .",0
629,U.S. trade officials said the Philippines and Thailand would be the main beneficiaries of the president 's action .,0

879,"In the tender offer supplement , Dow Jones discloses the different growth forecasts but says it views the 20 % growth rate "" as a hoped-for goal "" of Telerate 's management "" and not as a realistic basis on which to project the company 's likely future performance . """,0

912,"That would be a huge problem if it were to continue , because Unisys is betting its business on the assumption that customers want to move away from using operating systems that run on only one manufacturer 's equipment and toward systems -- mainly Unix -- that work on almost anyone 's machines .",1
913,"That , he said , is why Unisys is overhauling its whole business : It needs to prepare for a world in which profit margins will be lower than computer companies have been used to .",1
914,And Unisys is expected to do little better than break even in the fourth quarter . So Steve Milunovich at First Boston said he is cutting his earnings estimate for next year to $ 2 a share from $ 3.,1

919,"On top of that , the Blue Bell , Pa . , concern took a $ 230 million charge related to the layoffs of 8,000 employees .",0
920,"That is at the high end of the range of 7,000 to 8,000 employees that Unisys said a month ago would be laid off .",0
921,"Unisys said that should help it save $ 500 million a year in costs , again at the high end of the previously reported range of $ 400 million to $ 500 million .",0
922,"The company also took a write-off of $ 150 million to cover losses on some fixed-price defense contracts , as some new managers took a hard look at the prospects for that slow-growing business .",0
923,The tax payments will leave Unisys with $ 225 million in loss carry-forwards that will cut tax payments in future quarters .,0

925,"Still , Unisys said its European business was weak during the quarter , a worrisome sign given that the company has relied on solid results overseas to overcome weakness in the U.S. over the past several quarters .",0
926,The company also reported slower growth in another important business : systems that use the Unix operating system .,0
927,"Debt has risen to around $ 4 billion , or about 50 % of total capitalization .",0
928,"That means Unisys must pay about $ 100 million in interest every quarter , on top of $ 27 million in dividends on preferred stock .",0
929,"Jim Unruh , Unisys 's president , said he is approaching next year with caution .",0
930,"He said the strength of the world-wide economy is suspect , and does n't see much revenue growth in the cards .",0
931,He also said that the price wars flaring up in parts of the computer industry will continue through next year .,0
932,He said the move toward standard operating systems means customers are n't locked into buying from their traditional computer supplier and can force prices down .,0
933,""" The information-systems industry is still going to be a high-growth business , and we 're confident that we have tremendous assets as a company .",0

937,"But the company said Friday that it had losses of $ 673.3 million through the first nine months , compared with earnings a year earlier of $ 382.2 million , or $ 2.22 a share fully diluted , as revenue inched up 1.4 % to $ 7.13 billion from $ 7.03 billion .",0
938,Mr. Weil of Weil amp Associates said he will remain at $ 1 a share for next year but said he wonders whether even that low target is at risk .,0

941,"Now , following asset sales that shrank revenue by more than one-third this year alone , Control Data is flush with cash . So its senior executives are talking openly about possibly buying back some of the company 's $ 172.5 million in subordinated convertible debentures next year .",1
942,"Noting that the company is offering to buy back $ 154.2 million in senior notes paying 12 3/4 % , he said the response will help determine future debt-reduction efforts .",1
943,The offer was automatically triggered by the recent sale of Control Data 's Imprimis disk-drive business to Seagate Technology Inc.,1
944,"Through the first nine months , the company had a loss of $ 484 million , largely reflecting the closing of its supercomputer unit .",1
945,"Control Data 's semiconductor business , VTC Inc., continues to lose money , the executives acknowledged , but they said they consider some of the technology vital to national defense and so are reluctant to dispose of it .",1
946,"Control Data Corp., which just months ago was hemorrhaging financially , thinks it will be healthy enough soon to consider repurchasing public debt .",0
947,"Moreover , the company , whose go-it-alone approach nearly proved fatal , now sees alliances with others as the way back to prosperity in what it calls "" the data solutions "" business .",0
948,""" I 'm not saying everything is hunky-dory , but we have completed the transition , "" Robert M. Price , chairman and chief executive , said in an interview .",0

959,He would n't elaborate .,0
960,"Partly , costs will be held down through strategic technology alliances , management said .",0
961,Control Data recently announced an agreement with MIPS Computer Systems Inc. to jointly develop machines with simplified operating software .,0
962,"James E. Ousley , computer products group president , said such arrangements could help slash Control Data 's computer research and development costs in half by the end of 1990 .",0
963,"He disclosed that before Control Data scrapped its ETA Systems Inc. supercomputer business this past spring , those costs were running at nearly 35 % of group revenue .",0
964,"At the same time four of six design projects were spiked , he said .",0
965,"Asked how the company hopes to expand its computer hardware business , Mr. Ousley said it sees good opportunities in systems integration .",0
966,""" We think we 're getting only 10 % of the integration dollars our customers are spending , "" he said .",0
967,""" We 're in environments that are going to spend a lot of money on that . """,0
968,"Control Data mainframes are designed for numerically intensive computing users , such as the scientific , engineering and academic communities .",0
969,Utilities management is a major commercial niche .,0
970,"Reviewing the company 's scrape with disaster , Mr. Price conceded it had tried to do too much on its own .",0

974,"Statistics on acquisitions by foreigners vary in detail , because unlike Sansui , which is listed on the Tokyo and Osaka stock exchanges , most of the Japanese companies acquired by foreigners are privately held .",1
975,"While competitors moved production offshore in response to the sagging competitiveness of Japanese factories , Sansui lacked the money to build new plants in Southeast Asia .",1

978,Polly Peck International Inc.'s agreement to acquire 51 % of Sansui Electric Co. proves that foreign companies can acquire Japanese companies -- if the alternative for the Japanese company is extinction .,0
979,"Polly Peck , a fast-growing British conglomerate , will pay 15.6 billion yen ( $ 110 million ) for 39 million new shares of Sansui , a well-known maker of high-fidelity audio equipment that failed to adjust to changing market conditions .",0
980,"Japanese government officials , eager to rebut foreign criticism of Japanese investments overseas , hailed the transaction as proof foreigners can make similar investments in Japan .",0
981,"Polly Peck 's chairman , Asil Nadir , echoed the official Japanese view of the accord , which was announced Friday .",0
982,""" The myths that Japan is not open to concerns from outside has , I think , been demolished at a stroke , "" Mr. Nadir said .",0
983,But analysts say Sansui is a special case .,0
984,It expects to post a loss of 6.4 billion yen for the year ending tomorrow and its liabilities currently exceed its assets by about 13.8 billion yen .,0
985,""" If you find sound , healthy companies in Japan , they are not for sale , "" said George Watanabe , a management-consultant at Tokyo-based Asia Advisory Services Inc.",0
986,Nor do analysts expect the Sansui deal to touch off a fresh wave of foreign purchases .,0
987,"If the strong yen and the high stock prices of Japanese companies were n't deterrents enough , webs of cross-shareholdings between friendly Japanese companies and fiercely independent Japanese corporate attitudes repel most would-be acquirers .",0
988,"Usually when a Japanese company is ready to sell , it has few alternatives remaining , and the grim demeanors of Sansui 's directors at a joint news conference here left little doubt that this was not the company 's finest hour .",0
989,"Sansui was once one of Japan 's premier makers of expensive , high-quality stereo gear for audiophiles .",0
990,"But in recent years , the market has moved toward less expensive "" mini-component "" sets , miniaturized amplifiers and receivers and software players that could be stacked on top of each other .",0
991,"Some of Sansui 's fellow audio-specialty companies , such as Aiwa Co. and Pioneer Electric Corp., responded to the challenge by quickly bringing out mini-component products of their own , by moving heavily into the booming compact disk businesses or by diversifying into other consumer-electronics fields , including laser disks or portable cassette players .",0
992,Sansui was late into the mini-component business and failed to branch into other new businesses .,0
993,"As the yen soared in recent years , Sansui 's deepening financial problems became a vicious circle .",0
994,"But even a Japanese company that looks like a dog may turn out to be a good investment for a foreign concern , some management consultants maintain .",0
995,"Yoshihisa Murasawa , a management consultant for Booz - Allen amp Hamilton ( Japan ) Inc., said his firm will likely be recommending acquisitions of Japanese companies more often to foreign clients in the future .",0
996,""" Attitudes { toward being acquired } are still negative , but they 're becoming more positive , "" Mr. Murasawa said .",0
997,""" In some industries , like pharmaceuticals , acquisitions make sense . """,0
998,"Whether Polly Peck 's acquisition makes sense remains to be seen , but at the news conference , Mr. Nadir brimmed with self-confidence that he can turn Sansui around .",0
999,"Sansui , he said , is a perfect fit for Polly Peck 's electronics operations , which make televisions , videocassette recorders , microwaves and other products on an "" original equipment maker "" basis for sale under other companies ' brand names .",0
1000,"He said Polly Peck will greatly expand Sansui 's product line , using Sansui 's engineers to design the new products , and will move Sansui 's production of most products other than sophisticated audio gear offshore into Polly Peck 's own factories .",0
1001,"Such risk taking is an everyday matter for the brash Mr. Nadir , who is 25 % owner of Polly Peck as well as its chairman .",0
1002,"He took Polly Peck , once a small fabric wholesaler , and used it at as a base to build a conglomerate that has been doubling its profits annually since 1980 .",0
1003,"In September , it announced plans to acquire the tropical-fruit business of RJR Nabisco Inc.'s Del Monte foods unit for # 557 million ( $ 878 million ) .",0

1005,"In response to BellSouth 's amended pact , the Kirkland , Wash . , company extended its own offer to buy 22 million LIN shares for $ 125 apiece , which would give McCaw a 50.3 % controlling interest .",1
1006,"Under its revised proposal , Atlanta-based BellSouth would have a 50 % interest in the new cellular company and would be responsible for half of its debt .",1
1007,"But Kenneth Leon , a telecommunications analyst with Bear , Stearns amp Co., finds the BellSouth proposal still flawed because the company does n't have to wait five years to begin buying more LIN shares .",1
1008,"BellSouth 's revised proposal surprised many industry analysts , especially because of the company 's willingness to accept some dilution of future earnings .",1
1009,"The bolstered cellular agreement between BellSouth Corp. and LIN Broadcasting Corp. carries heightened risks and could fail to fend off McCaw Cellular Communications Inc., the rival suitor for LIN .",0
1010,"Moreover , the amended pact shows how McCaw 's persistence has pushed LIN and BellSouth into a corner , forcing huge debt on the proposed new company .",0
1011,"The debt , estimated at $ 4.7 billion , could mortgage the cellular company 's future earning power in order to placate some LIN holders in the short term .",0
1012,The plan still calls for LIN to combine its cellular telephone properties with BellSouth 's and to spin off its broadcasting operations .,0
1013,"But under new terms of the agreement , announced Friday , LIN holders would receive a special cash dividend of $ 42 a share , representing a payout of about $ 2.23 billion , shortly before the proposed merger .",0
1014,"LIN said it expects to borrow the money to pay the dividend , but commitments from banks still have n't been obtained .",0
1015,"Under previous terms , holders would have received a dividend of only $ 20 a share .",0
1016,"In addition , New York-based LIN would exercise its right to buy out for $ 1.9 billion the 55 % equity interest of its partner , Metromedia Co., in a New York cellular franchise .",0
1017,That money also would have to be borrowed .,0
1018,"In effect , McCaw has forced LIN 's hand by bidding $ 1.9 billion for the stake earlier this month .",0
1019,""" We 're taking on more debt than we would have liked to , "" acknowledged Michael Plouf , LIN 's vice president and treasurer .",0
1020,"Although he expressed confidence that the proposed new company 's cash flow would be sufficient to cover interest payments on the debt , he estimated that the company would n't be profitable until 1994 or later .",0
1021,Analyst estimate the value of the BellSouth proposal at about $ 115 to $ 125 a share .,0
1022,They value McCaw 's bid at $ 112 to $ 118 a share .,0
1023,The previous BellSouth pact was valued at about $ 98 to $ 110 a share .,0
1024,"McCaw , the largest provider of cellular telephone service in the U.S., already owns about 9.4 % of LIN 's stock .",0
1025,Analysts said they expect McCaw to escalate the bidding again .,0
1026,""" This game is n't over yet , "" said Joel D. Gross , a vice president at Donaldson , Lufkin amp Jenrette Securities Corp. "" At some point , it will become non-economical for one company .",0
1027,"But I do n't think we 're at that point yet . """,0
1028,"The provision , described as "" back-end "" protection , would require BellSouth to pay a price equivalent to what an outside party might have to pay .",0
1029,McCaw 's bid also has a similar clause .,0
1030,Only McCaw 's proposal requires the company to begin an auction process in June 1994 for remaining shares at third-party prices .,0
1031,"To mollify shareholders concerned about the long-term value of the company under the BellSouth - LIN agreement , BellSouth also agreed to pay as much as $ 10 a share , or $ 540 million , if , after five years , the trading value of the new cellular company is n't as high as the value that shareholders would have realized from the McCaw offer .",0
1032,""" We 're very pleased with the new deal .",0
1033,"We did n't expect BellSouth to be so responsive , "" said Frederick A. Moran , president of Moran Asset Management Inc., which holds 500,000 LIN shares .",0
1034,"BellSouth 's "" back-end protection was flawed previously .",0
1035,We think this is a superior deal to McCaw 's .,0

1038,he asked .,0
1039,""" There 's nothing preventing BellSouth from buying up shares in the meanwhile . """,0
1040,"Indeed , BellSouth 's cellular operations were among the first in the country to become profitable .",0
1041,"For 1988 , BellSouth earned $ 1.7 billion , or $ 3.51 a share , on revenue of $ 13.6 billion .",0
1042,"Analysts were predicting 1990 BellSouth earnings in the range of $ 3.90 a share , or $ 1.9 billion , but now those estimates are being scaled back .",0

1045,"The proposed BellSouth - LIN cellular company , including the newly acquired Metromedia stake , would give the new entity 55 million potential customers , including about 35 million in the nation 's top 10 markets .",0
1046,"Mr. Leon of Bear Stearns speculated that McCaw , in an attempt to buy time , might consider filing an antitrust suit against BellSouth with the Justice Department and U.S. District Judge Harold Greene , who oversees enforcement of the consent decree that broke up the Bell system in 1984 .",0
1047,"Indeed , McCaw seemed to hint at that option in a brief statement .",0

1054,"Of course , there were sell programs in past years , too , but they seem to hurt market makers more painfully these days . That 's largely because of defensive measures they adopted after the 1987 crash , when individual investors fled the market and trading activity dwindled .",1
1055,"And to protect their reduced capital investment from eroding further , market makers became quicker to lower price quotes when sell programs are in progress .",1

1269,"The No. 1 U.S. auto maker then wrote Jaguar that it intends "" to go to that 15 % "" level once it wins the U.S. clearance to go beyond $ 15 million , a Jaguar spokesman said yesterday .",0
1270,"Speculative investors , betting on an imminent clash between Ford and GM , pushed up Jaguar 's share price five pence ( eight U.S. cents ) to a near-record 720 pence ( $ 11.60 ) in late trading on London 's stock exchange yesterday .",0
1271,"Since Tuesday , the shares have gained nearly 4 % .",0
1272,But an all-out bidding war between the world 's top auto giants for Britain 's leading luxury-car maker seems unlikely .,0
1273,""" We will not go over a certain level , "" said David N. McCammon , Ford 's vice president for finance , at a news conference yesterday in Dearborn , Mich .",0
1274,""" There 's some price at which we 'd stop bidding . """,0
1275,He would n't specify what it was .,0
1276,""" The golden share is a single share , but it is the magic share . """,0
1277,The government retained the single share after selling its stake in Jaguar in 1984 -- part of a nationalistic practice of protecting former government-owned enterprises to deflect criticism of privatization .,0
1278,"The 15 % restriction covers any would-be suitor , British or foreign .",0
1279,Ford is willing to bid for 100 % of Jaguar 's shares if both the government and Jaguar shareholders agree to relax the anti-takeover barrier prematurely .,0
1280,"As Jaguar 's biggest holder and Britain 's biggest car maker , Ford could turn up the heat by convening a special shareholders ' meeting and urging holders to drop the limits early .",0
1281,It has relinquished a golden share only once before -- during British Petroleum Co.'s # 2.5 billion ( $ 4 billion ) takeover of Britoil PLC in 1988 .,0
1282,"While the visit was unrelated to Jaguar , GM Chairman Roger Smith answered the legislators ' questions about it over lunch Tuesday .",0
1283,"He said Jaguar "" should n't be smothered by anyone else , "" recalled one participant .",0
1284,Politics also influences the government 's thinking on the anti-takeover restriction .,0
1285,"The Conservatives do n't dare jeopardize marginal Tory seats in Coventry , where Jaguar has headquarters , nor can the government easily back down on promised protection for a privatized company while it proceeds with controversial plans to privatize most of Britain 's water and electricity industries .",0

1290,"But tremors are likely in the junk-bond market , which has helped to finance the takeover boom of recent years .",1
1291,"Those withdrawals , most of which were transferred to other T. Rowe Price funds , followed little change in the fund 's sales picture this year through August . """,1
1292,"Junk-fund holders have barely broken even this year , as fat interest payments barely managed to offset declining prices .",1
1293,"Billions of investors ' dollars are pouring out of the nation 's junk-bond mutual funds , undermining a pillar of support in the already reeling junk market .",0
1294,"Last week alone , an eye-popping $ 1.6 billion flowed out of the junk funds , or nearly 5 % of their total assets , according to estimates by Dalbar Financial Services Inc., a Boston research firm .",0
1295,"In the past two months the nation 's 88 junk funds have lost a total of about $ 6 billion -- more than 15 % of assets -- through sales or transfers of junk-fund shares , Dalbar says .",0
1296,It made the estimates based on data collected from more than a dozen big junk funds .,0
1297,"Interviews with three major fund groups -- Fidelity Investments , Vanguard Group Inc. and T. Rowe Price Associates Inc. -- confirm the trend .",0
1298,"Their junk funds combined have had net outflows totaling nearly $ 500 million , or about 13 % of their junk fund assets , in the past two months .",0
1299,Some fund managers say negative publicity has exacerbated investors ' concern about recent declines in junk-bond prices .,0
1300,""" People have been seeing headline after headline after headline and saying : ` I ca n't take it anymore -- I 'm getting out , ' "" says Kurt Brouwer of Brouwer amp Janachowski , a San Francisco investment adviser .",0
1301,The withdrawals could spell trouble for the $ 200 billion junk market .,0
1302,"If the heavy outflows continue , fund managers will face increasing pressure to sell off some of their junk to pay departing investors in the weeks ahead .",0
1303,"Such selling could erode prices of high-yield junk bonds , already weakened by a rash of corporate credit problems .",0
1304,"Mutual fund groups have n't lost control of much of the outgoing money , says Louis Harvey , Dalbar 's president .",0
1305,"Mutual fund officials say that investors have transferred most of it into their money market accounts , and to a lesser extent , government-bond funds .",0
1306,So the impact on the $ 950 billion mutual fund industry as a whole probably will be slight .,0
1307,The 88 mutual funds investing solely in junk bonds hold assets of about $ 32 billion .,0
1308,"Other funds hold a smattering of junk bonds , too .",0
1309,The $ 1.5 billion Fidelity High Income Fund has had a net outflow of about $ 150 million in the past two months .,0
1310,"About $ 60 million streamed out last week alone , double the level of the week following last month 's Campeau Corp. credit squeeze .",0

1317,"Still , two-thirds of the outflow has been steered into other Vanguard portfolios , says Brian Mattes , a vice president .",0
1318,The fund now holds a cash position of about 15 % .,0
1319,"At the $ 932 million T. Rowe Price High Yield Fund , investors yanked out about $ 182 million in the past two months .",0

1321,"Fidelity 's junk fund has fallen 2.08 % this year through Oct . 19 , Lipper says ;",0
1322,the Vanguard fund rose 1.84 % ;,0
1323,and the T. Rowe Price fund edged up 0.66 % .,0
1324,"People who remain in junk funds now could get hit again , some analysts and fund specialists say .",0
1325,"Many funds in recent weeks and months have been selling their highest-quality junk issues , such as RJR Nabisco , to raise cash to meet expected redemptions .",0
1326,Funds might be forced to accept lower prices if they expand their selling to the securities of less-creditworthy borrowers .,0
1327,"And then , asset values of the funds could plunge more than they have so far .",0
1328,The warning by the U.S. attorney 's office follows two decisions by the U.S. Supreme Court last June .,1
1329,"If the government succeeds in seizing Mr. Antar 's assets , he could be left without top-flight legal representation , because his attorneys are likely to quit , according to individuals familiar with the case .",1
1330,"In a letter , prosecutors told Mr. Antar 's lawyers that because of the recent Supreme Court rulings , they could expect that any fees collected from Mr. Antar may be seized .",1
1331,The government is sharpening its newest weapon against white-collar defendants : the power to prevent them from paying their legal bills .,0
1332,And defense lawyers are warning that they wo n't stick around if they do n't get paid .,0
1333,"The issue has come to a boil in Newark , N.J., where federal prosecutors have warned lawyers for Eddie Antar that if the founder and former chairman of Crazy Eddie Inc. is indicted , the government may move to seize the money that Mr. Antar is using to pay legal fees .",0
1334,""" The people who suffer in the short run are defendants , but the people who suffer in the long run are all of the people , because there wo n't be a vigorous private bar to defend the Bill of Rights , "" says Gerald Lefcourt , a criminal defense attorney who says he has turned down a number of cases to avoid possible fee seizures .",0
1335,"Mr. Antar is being investigated by a federal grand jury in Newark , where prosecutors have told him that they may soon seek an indictment on racketeering and securities fraud charges .",0
1336,"Under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations law , or RICO , the government has the authority to seek to freeze or seize a defendant 's assets before trial .",0
1337,"According to individuals familiar with Mr. Antar 's case , prosecutors issued their warning this week after one of Mr. Antar 's attorneys asked whether legal fees might be subject to seizure .",0
1338,"Therefore , they said , the money can be taken from the lawyers even after they are paid .",0
1339,"Justin Feldman and Jack Arseneault , attorneys for Mr. Antar , both declined to comment on the matter .",0
1340,"In Newark , U.S. Attorney Samuel A. Alito said , "" I do n't think there 's any legal reason to limit forfeiture of attorney 's fees to drug cases . """,0
1341,"Mr. Alito said his office "" just responded to an attorney 's question about whether we would go after attorney 's fees , and that is different from actually doing it , although we reserve that right . """,0
1342,Mr. Antar was charged last month in a civil suit filed in federal court in Newark by the Securities and Exchange Commission .,0
1343,"In that suit , the SEC accused Mr. Antar of engaging in a "" massive financial fraud "" to overstate the earnings of Crazy Eddie , Edison , N.J., over a three-year period .",0
1344,"Through his lawyers , Mr. Antar has denied allegations in the SEC suit and in civil suits previously filed by shareholders against Mr. Antar and others .",0
1345,The SEC has alleged that Mr. Antar aimed to pump up the company 's stock price through false financial statements in order to sell his stake and reap huge profits .,0
1346,"Mr. Antar , the SEC said , made more than $ 60 million from the sale of his shares between 1985 and 1987 .",0
1347,The Justice Department has emphasized that the government 's fee-forfeiture power is to be used sparingly .,0
1348,"According to department policy , prosecutors must make a strong showing that lawyers ' fees came from assets tainted by illegal profits before any attempts at seizure are made .",0

1355,"Computer experts familiar with the flaws , found in Intel 's 80486 chip , say the defects do n't affect the average user and are likely to be cleared up before most computers using the chip as their "" brains "" appear on the market sometime next year .",0
1356,"Intel said that last week a customer discovered two flaws in its 80486 microprocessor chip 's "" floating-point unit "" , a set of circuits that do certain calculations .",0
1357,"On Friday , Intel began notifying customers about the bugs which cause the chip to give wrong answers for some mathematical calculations .",0
1358,"But while International Business Machines Corp. and Compaq Computer Corp. say the bugs will delay products , most big computer makers said the flaws do n't affect them .",0
1359,""" Bugs like this are just a normal part of product development , "" said Richard Archuleta , director of Hewlett - Packard Co.'s advanced systems development .",0
1360,Hewlett announced last week that it planned to ship a computer based on the 486 chip early next year .,0
1361,""" These bugs do n't affect our schedule at all , "" he said .",0
1362,"Likewise , AST Research Inc. and Sun Microsystems Inc. said the bugs wo n't delay their development of 486-based machines .",0
1363,""" We have n't modified our schedules in any way , "" said a Sun spokesman .",0
1364,"To switch to another vendor 's chips , "" would not definitely be an option , "" he said .",0
1365,Most of Compaq 's decline is being attributed to a third-quarter earnings report that came in at the low end of analysts ' expectations .,0
1366,Intel said it had corrected the problems and would start producing bugless chips next week .,0
1367,""" We should not be seeing any more , "" said Bill Rash , Intel 's director for the 486 chip .",0
1368,"What 's more , the bugs only emerge on esoteric applications such as computer-aided design and scientific calculations , he said , and then very seldom .",0
1369,""" These errata do not affect business programs , "" he said .",0
1370,"The bugs will cause problems in "" specific and rare circumstances that will not occur in typical applications "" such as word-processing and spreadsheets , said Michael Slater , editor of the Microprocessor Report , an industry newsletter .",0
1371,"Sun , Hewlett - Packard and others say Intel is n't wholly to blame for the snafu .",0
1372,"The real culprits , they said , are computer makers such as IBM that have jumped the gun to unveil 486-based products .",0
1373,"Those companies are paying the price for taking the risk . """,0
1374,"In late September , IBM began shipping a plug-in card that converts its PS / 2 model 70-A21 from a 80386 machine to an 80486 machine .",0
1375,An IBM spokeswoman said the company told customers Monday about the bugs and temporarily stopped shipping the product .,0
1376,"IBM has no plans to recall its add-on cards , the spokeswoman said , and could probably circumvent the bugs without long product delays .",0
1377,""" We do n't look at this as a major problem for us , "" she said .",0
1378,"Compaq , which said it discovered the bugs , still plans to announce new 486 products on Nov . 6 .",0
1379,"Because of the glitch , however , the company said it does n't know when its machine will be commercially available .",0
1380,"That 's a break from Compaq tradition , because the company does n't announce products until they 're actually at the dealers .",0
1381,"The problem is being ballyhooed , experts say , because the 486 is Intel 's future flagship .",0
1382,Intel 's microprocessors are the chips of choice in many of today 's personal computers and the 80486 microprocessor is the spearhead of the company 's bid to guard that spot in the next generation of machines .,0
1383,""" Although these sorts of bugs are not at all uncommon , the 486 is an extremely high-profile product , "" said Mr. Slater , the newsletter editor .",0
1384,"Intel 's 80486 chip is the Corvette of Intel 's microprocessors , a super-fast , super-expensive chip that only the most power-hungry computer users are likely to buy for at least several years .",0
1385,"Unveiled last April , the chip crams 1.2 million transistors on a sliver of silicon , more than four times as many as on Intel 's earlier model , 80386 .",0
1386,"Intel clocks the chip 's speed at 15 million instructions per second , or MIPs .",0
1387,That 's four times as fast as the 386 .,0
1388,"Machines using the 486 are expected to challenge higher-priced work stations and minicomputers in applications such as so-called servers , which connect groups of computers together , and in computer-aided design .",0
1389,"But while the chip 's speed in processing power is dazzling , it 's real strength lies in its software inheritance .",0
1390,The 486 is the descendant of a long series of Intel chips that began dominating the market ever since IBM picked the 16-bit 8088 chip for its first personal computer .,0
1391,"( A 16-bit microprocessor processes 16 pieces of data at a time and is slower than newer , 32-bit chips . )",0
1392,"Since then , Intel has cornered a large part of the market with successive generations of 16-bit and 32-bit chips , all of which can run software written for previous models .",0
1393,That 's what will keep computer makers coming in spite of the irritation of bugs .,0
1394,"Big personal computer makers and many makers of engineering workstations are developing 486-based machines , which are expected to reach the market early next year .",0
1395,"Of the big computer makers , only Apple Computer Co. bases its machines on Motorola chips instead .",0

1426,"If holders avoid tendering to Paribas , he added , they can expect strong dividends again next year .",0
1427,"Analysts noted that over the past 20 years , Mr. Fournier has built his company through astute stock-market activity and has warded off at least three takeover attempts .",0

1430,Mr. de Cholet said Mr. Fournier 's biggest hope was to somehow persuade regulatory authorities to block the bid .,0
1431,"Paribas still needs the go-ahead from the Commission des Operations de Bourse , a government regulatory agency , but analysts said that is considered likely .",0
1432,"Mr. Fournier also noted that Navigation Mixte joined Paribas 's core of shareholders when Paribas was denationalized in 1987 , and said it now holds just under 5 % of Paribas 's shares .",0
1433,"Once he realized that Paribas 's intentions were n't friendly , he said , but before the bid was launched , he sought approval to boost his Paribas stake above 10 % .",0

1672,"Thrift officials said the $ 300 million reserve will be adjusted quarterly and will reflect the rate of dispositions and market conditions .

1673,"Previously , Columbia did n't have to adjust the book value of its junk-bond holdings to reflect declines in market prices , because it held the bonds as long-term investments .",1

1697,Some experts now predict Anheuser 's entry into the fray means near-term earnings trouble for all the industry players .,0
1698,"The St. Louis company said major rivals , Philip Morris Co.'s Miller Brewing unit and Adolph Coors Co. "" have been following a policy of continuous and deep discounting for at least the past 18 months "" on their premium brands , pricing their product as much as 25 cents a 12-pack below Anheuser 's Budweiser label in many markets .",0

1707,"Beneath the tepid news-release jargon lies a powerful threat from the brewing giant , which last year accounted for about 41 % of all U.S. beer sales and is expected to see that grow to 42.5 % in the current year .",0

1713,"But Smith Barney 's Mr. Doyle , who yesterday trimmed his 1990 Anheuser earnings projection to $ 2.95 a share from $ 3.10 , called the market 's reaction "" justified . """,0
1714,"While the third-quarter earnings were a "" moderate disappointment , "" he said , "" the real bad news is the intensity of price competition "" in the premium-beer sector .",0
1715,"According to Mr. Steinman , the newsletter publisher , Anheuser 's market share is nearly twice that of its nearest competitor , Miller Brewing , which had a 21.2 % stake last year .",0

1727,"Jay Stevens , an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds , said he expected the Sunnyvale , Calif . , company to earn 35 cents a share for the quarter and said the firm 's weaker profit was partly the result of increased competition from International Business Machines Corp., Amdahl 's principal competitor for mainframe sales .",1
