520,Israel has publicly declared that it will respond to an Iraqi attack on Jordan because it wo n't allow Iraq 's dangerous army to take control of Jordan 's long border with Israel .,1
521,There are disagreements among experts about how much pressure will be needed to make Saddam Hussein decide he 's up against the wall and whether simple economic pressure will ever be enough .,1
522,""" That shows he 's nervous about pinpointing his location , either because he 's afraid we 'll find him , or that internal enemies will , "" says one U.S. official .",1
523,The unpredictability of Iraq 's leader is a principal reason the U.S. is going to such great lengths to build a mammoth force in and around Saudi Arabia .,1
524,And the U.S. is taking similar steps to ensure that its naval force is adequate to carry out a blockade of Iraq and support a war if necessary .,1
561,But even continued military success carries political and diplomatic risks for President Bush and the U.S.,1

569,"After cabling world leaders about his intention to give Saddam Hussein a final deadline to exit Kuwait , he offered him a week to withdraw fully , instead of the four days he originally considered , because of objections from some European partners that four days seemed punitive and unrealistic .",1
570,"Meanwhile , the U.S. hopes , economic sanctions and an international arms embargo will remain in effect until Iraq pays war reparations to Kuwait to cover war damages . That would undermine any chances of rebuilding either Iraq or its armed forces in short order as long as Saddam Hussein remains in power .",1
571,"If that 's true , the narrowing of his support would make it easier for someone to push him aside from within .",1
