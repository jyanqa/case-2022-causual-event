# Shared Task 3 CASE 2022

The repositort contains the work for subtask 1 of Shared Task 3 of CASE@EMNLP 2022. 

The task is to identify causal structure in sentences from news corpus.

In the work, we have considered several large language models and also considered the annotation information present in the dataset to come up with a modified loss for causality detection.

The code is reproducible and the results can be reproduced by running run_script.py.

To obtain the results, run run_script.py using:

```
python3 run_script.py --model_name <name of model> --loss_name <name of loss>
```
